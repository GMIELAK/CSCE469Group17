## Project Overview
This repository contains multiple web application projects generated by different Large Language Models (LLMs). Each project implements a small, security-sensitive web application (primarily password manager or authentication-style applications) that was generated using a **standardized prompt**.

The goal of this assignment is to **evaluate and compare the security of code generated by different LLMs**, using both manual inspection and automated security analysis tools. All projects follow a similar structure to ensure a fair and reproducible comparison.

The LLMs evaluated in this repository include:
- Claude
- Gemini 2.5 Pro
- GPT-4.1
- GPT-5.0
- Grok

These projects were analyzed for common web security issues such as SQL injection, insecure authentication, plaintext password storage, and missing input validation, as outlined in our project proposal.

## Repository Structure
Each LLM has its own top-level directory. **The internal structure is not consistent across models**, which is an intentional result of independent LLM-generated code.

Top-level directories:
```
CSCE469Group17-Claude/
CSCE469Group17-Gemini-2.5-Pro/
CSCE469Group17-GPT-4.1/
CSCE469Group17-GPT-5.0/
CSCE469Group17-Grok/
```

Within each project, the runnable application may be located in different folders, such as:
- `password-manager/`
- `public/`
- `client/` and `server/`
- `backend/` and `front/`

These differences reflect how each LLM structured the project on its own. **The exact folder to run is specified in the setup instructions below and should be followed precisely**.

Each project is intended to be run locally for testing and security analysis.

---

## Prerequisites
Before running any of the projects, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (included with Node.js)

The projects were tested on standard desktop environments (Windows/macOS/Linux).

---

## Setup and Installation (Required for Each Project)
Each LLM-generated project has a slightly different run configuration. Follow the instructions below **exactly for each model**.

---

### Claude
Navigate into the Claude project directory:

```bash
cd CSCE469Group17-Claude/password-manager
npm install
npm start
```

---

### GPT-4.1
This project is split into separate client and server directories.

**Server:**
```bash
cd CSCE469Group17-GPT-4.1/server
npm install
npm start
```

**Client (separate terminal):**
```bash
cd CSCE469Group17-GPT-4.1/client
npm install
npm start
```

---

### GPT-5.0
Navigate into the public folder:

```bash
cd CSCE469Group17-GPT-5.0/public
npm install
npm start
```

---

### Grok
Navigate into the password manager directory inside the Grok folder:

```bash
cd CSCE469Group17-Grok/password-manager
npm install
npm start
```

---

### Gemini 2.5 Pro
This project requires running the backend and frontend separately.

**Backend:**
```bash
cd CSCE469Group17-Gemini-2.5-Pro/backend
npm install
npm start
```

**Frontend (separate terminal):**
```bash
cd CSCE469Group17-Gemini-2.5-Pro/front
npm install
npm run dev
```


---

## Environment Variables
No environment variable configuration is required to run any of the projects.

All applications can be run directly after installing dependencies using npm, and no `.env` files are needed.

```
PORT=5000
```

---

## Security Analysis Methodology
The projects were evaluated using a consistent methodology:

1. **Standardized Prompting** – Each LLM received the same functional requirements
2. **Functionality Verification** – Applications were tested to ensure they run correctly
3. **Manual Security Review** – Inspection for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, plaintext credentials)
4. **Automated Tools** – Vulnerability scanning using industry tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Snyk, SonarQube where applicable)
5. **Comparison Across Models** – Vulnerabilities were recorded and compared between LLMs

---

## Important Notes for Graders / Reviewers
- Each project was generated independently in a fresh LLM session
- Code quality and security issues are **intentional results of LLM generation**, not manual fixes
- Do **not** reuse `node_modules` between projects
- All projects are standalone and must be run independently

---

## Troubleshooting
**Port already in use**
- Stop other running Node.js servers
- Or modify the backend port in the project configuration

**Frontend not connecting to backend**
- Ensure the backend is running first
- Verify API URLs in frontend source code

**Missing dependencies**
- Make sure `npm install` was run in both frontend and backend directories

## Academic Integrity Note
This repository is provided solely for academic evaluation as part of CSCE 469/869. The code is intentionally analyzed for insecure patterns and should not be used as a production-ready security reference.
