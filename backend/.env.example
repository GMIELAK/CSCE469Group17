# Copy this file to .env and fill in real values before running the backend.
# Example Postgres connection for local development:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost:5432/local_vault?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="a_super_secret_key"

# If a developer doesn't run Postgres locally, they can skip DB usage by setting SKIP_DB=true.
# When SKIP_DB=true the backend exports a lightweight mock Prisma client so the server and
# non-DB work (frontend, UI, routes that don't touch the DB) can run without migrations.

# Notes:
# - Do NOT commit the real .env file with secrets.
# - The project uses PostgreSQL as the primary DB for development.
